# Project 1 - Graphing Stock Exchange Data

## Historical NASDAQ Composite Data Set

My data set is a `.csv` file of the historical data for the NASDAQ Composite stock index that I downloaded from Yahoo Finance. It includes information about the price such as the high and low. It has this data for once every month for the past 36 years. It is named `nasdaq_historical_data_36_yr.csv` in this data folder.

## Obtaining this Data Set

I downloaded this data set from Yahoo Finance by going on the [website](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC/history?p=%5EIXIC), and on the "Finance Home" area I searched for the NASDAQ Composite stock index. After this, I clicked on "historical data" and then clicked on time period and chose "Max" to see all the available data. Under frequency, I chose "monthly." Once I made all these selections, I clicked the "Download" button, and the `.csv` file downloaded to my computer, where I was able to rename it and move it to the appropriate folder.

## Details About the Data Set

The columns that are the most important for my project are the 'Date' and 'Close' columns, as I am looking to plot the date along with the closing price of the index for that specific date on a graph. The 'Date' column contains the date, and the 'Close' column contains the closing index price recorded for each date.
